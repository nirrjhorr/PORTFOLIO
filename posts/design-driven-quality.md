## Introduction

In modern product development, quality does not start with testing a finished application. It starts much earlier, at the design stage. For QA engineers, design artifacts are not just visual references. They are powerful inputs for validation, verification, and early testing that help prevent defects before development begins.

This is where design collaboration tools come into play, enabling QA to shift quality checks left and contribute meaningfully even before implementation starts.

## Validation and Verification at the Design Stage

Before discussing testing, it is important to understand how validation and verification apply to design reviews.

**Validation** focuses on answering whether the right thing is being designed. From a QA perspective, this means checking whether user flows make sense, whether the experience aligns with real user behavior, and whether the design solves the intended problem. 

**Verification**, on the other hand, checks whether the design follows defined standards and requirements. This includes consistency, correctness, and alignment with specifications. QA verifies that what is designed matches product requirements, design guidelines, and usability expectations.

## Static Testing Through Design Review

Testing designs is a form of static testing. Static testing means evaluating artifacts without running the application. At this stage, QA examines:
*   Screen completeness and navigation logic.
*   User journeys and edge states.
*   Consistency across different flows.

Because no code is involved, defects found here are far cheaper to fix and often prevent development rework.

## UI and UX Validation

Design files give QA a clear visual expectation. Testers can validate layout consistency, spacing, alignment, font usage, and color contrast early. Furthermore, design prototypes allow QA to walk through user journeys, identifying confusing paths, unnecessary steps, or missing transitions that may frustrate users later.

## Identifying Gaps and Accessibility

QA plays a key role in identifying missing states like error, empty, loading, or disabled actions. Accessibility is also easier to address during design. QA can review text contrast, readable font sizes, and clear visual hierarchy to ensure inclusive design before implementation begins.

## Conclusion

Testing should not wait for a build. By validating and verifying designs through static testing, QA engineers help shape quality at its foundation. Design reviews are not just a designer’s responsibility. When QA actively participates, products become clearer, more usable, and more consistent before they are ever built.
